# MNIST CNN using PyTorch

Basic custom CNN for MNIST dataset classification using PyTorch. If you are getting started with pytorch and want to get some elementary example, this notebook is for you :)

#### NOTE :
The interesting part is, the training code can be used for any other CNN model. You can play with the CNN architecture even without touching the training part. However, I would encourage you to play with the training code also, such as changing Epochs, trying different loss functions etc.
